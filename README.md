# Blog Management System with Express.js

Create a blog management system using Express.js, where users can create, read, update, and delete their own blogs. The data will be stored in a JSON file and accessed using json-server. Users will interact with the system using Postman and must include a unique ID in the request headers.

## Requirements:
1. Set up a basic Express.js server.
2. Integrate json-server to handle the storage of blog data in a JSON file.
3. Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blogs.
4. Use Axios to fetch data from the json-server.
5. Implement middleware to ensure that users can only access their own blogs.
6. Utilize Postman to interact with the API.
7. Include a unique ID in the header of each request sent from Postman.
8. Document your APIs for easy understanding.

## Folder Structure:
- **Controllers:** Contains logic for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Models:** Defines the structure of blog data and interacts with the JSON file.
- **Routes:** Defines application routes and maps them to controllers.
- **Middlewares:** Contains custom middleware functions for request processing.
- **Api:** Stores API documentation and related files.
- **.env:** Configuration file for environment variables.
- **server.js:** Entry point for the Express.js server.

## Dependencies:
- express: For building web applications with Node.js.
- dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
- axios: For making HTTP requests from the server.
- json-server: For creating a fake REST API using a JSON file as the data source.
- nodemon (dev dependency): For automatically restarting the server during development.

## Instructions:
1. Clone the starter repository or set up a new Node.js project.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn (`npm install express dotenv axios json-server nodemon --save`).
3. Create the folder structure as described above.
4. Set up the Express.js server in `server.js`.
5. Define routes in the `Routes` folder and link them to corresponding controllers.
6. Implement CRUD operations in the `Controllers` folder.
7. Define data models in the `Models` folder.
8. Implement middleware functions in the `Middlewares` folder to restrict access to user-specific data.
9. Configure json-server to serve the JSON file containing blog data.
11. Test your APIs using Postman, ensuring that users can only access their own blogs by including their unique ID in the request headers.
12. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully, providing meaningful error messages.
13. Write clear and concise documentation explaining how to set up and run the project.

Remember to encourage participants to ask questions, explore additional features, and seek clarification as needed. Happy coding!
